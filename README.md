## Learning Objectives

-   At least four different sorting algorithms
-   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-   What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks
### 0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the  [Bubble sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/fCItpIfgmE07fFbHBUToeg "Bubble sort")  algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You’re expected to print the  `array`  after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file  `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

### 1. Insertion sort

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the  [Insertion sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/4ueB1I1MkNypoTBXR0YX3g "Insertion sort")  algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);`
-   You are not allowed to modify the integer  `n`  of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
-   You’re expected to print the  `list`  after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file  `1-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

### 2. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the  [Selection sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/_DodgdySm5bPerpQm1LhwQ "Selection sort")  algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You’re expected to print the  `array`  after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file  `2-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

### 3. Quick sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the  [Quick sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/VoeZ2Hwp4Q0piTJ3OODY3w "Quick sort")  algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You must implement the  `Lomuto`  partition scheme.
-   The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
-   You’re expected to print the  `array`  after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file  `3-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

### 4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the  [Shell sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/n1R5L9_ySu3ZE7JqIqIM0Q "Shell sort")  algorithm, using the  `Knuth sequence`

-   Prototype:  `void shell_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You must use the following sequence of intervals (a.k.a the Knuth sequence):
    -   `n+1 = n * 3 + 1`
    -   `1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...`
-   You’re expected to print the  `array`  each time you decrease the interval (See example below).
